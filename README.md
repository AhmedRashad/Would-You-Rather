# Would You Rather?

##  Overview
This is the second project in the React Nanodegree Program by Udacity.

The aim is to use React and Redux to build a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game.

The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules. In the app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.


## How to Run:

* Download project.
* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`.
* Start the development server with `npm start`.

## Important
As the app works with a pseudo backend server, there is no data persistence and hence, any new questions or answers will be lost by performing a browser refresh.
